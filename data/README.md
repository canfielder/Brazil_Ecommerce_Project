# Data Import

I was unable to upload the full dataset to Github due to it's size. To use this R Project, download the dataset from kaggle and extract the zipped CSV files into this /data folder. Do no change the names of any of the files. Once the extracted CSV files are in the data folder, the R Markdown files will work.
